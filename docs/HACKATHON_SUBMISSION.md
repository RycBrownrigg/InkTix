# InkTix - Polkadot Alumni Hackathon Submission

## Executive Summary

InkTix represents a groundbreaking cross-chain ticket marketplace network that revolutionizes the over $50 billion global ticketing industry by utilizing Polkadot's XCM technology.

In contrast to conventional siloed platforms, InkTix establishes a cohesive ecosystem where specialized brokers retain their expertise, while users benefit from seamless access to events across all connected parachains. The platform exemplifies practical blockchain application through functional XCM transfers, NFT-based ticket authentication, and a production-ready frontend that effectively addresses critical industry challenges such as scalping, fraud, and fragmented discovery.

By harnessing Polkadot's multi-chain architecture, we facilitate cross-chain liquidity, transparent pricing, and anti-fraud mechanisms, while reducing platform fees by 75-85% in comparison to traditional ticketing systems. The live demonstration showcases operational XCM transfers from Westend Asset Hub to destination parachains, thereby validating the feasibility of cross-chain ticketing for mainstream adoption.

## Project Overview

InkTix represents an innovative cross-chain sports ticketing platform developed on the Polkadot network. It utilizes XCM (Cross-Consensus Message) technology to facilitate smooth ticket transactions across various parachains. The platform exemplifies practical blockchain application through genuine XCM transfers, integration of smart contracts, and its readiness for production deployment frontend.
